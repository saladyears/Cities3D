Creates a DSP unit, and places it in the DSP chain position specified by the priority<BR>
parameter.  Read the remarks section carefully for issues regarding DSP units.<BR>
DSP units are freed with FSOUND_DSP_Free.<BR>

<H3>Parameters</H3>
<TABLE>
<TR VALIGN=top><TD><I>callback</I></TD>
<TD>This is a pointer to your DSP Unit callback, of type FSOUND_DSPCALLBACK.<BR>
The prototype for a callback is declared in the following fashion.<BR>
Callbacks must return a pointer to the buffer you work on, so that<BR>
the next dsp unit can work on it.  <BR>
Here is the simplest case:<BR>
void *callback(void *originalbuffer, void *newbuffer, int length, void *userdata)<BR>
{<BR>
// originalbuffer = fsounds original mixbuffer.<BR>
// newbuffer = the buffer passed from the previous DSP unit.<BR>
// length = length in samples at this mix time.<BR>
// param = user parameter passed through in FSOUND_DSP_Create.<BR>
//<BR>
// modify the buffer in some fashion<BR>
return newbuffer;<BR>
}<BR>
See the definition of FSOUND_DSPCALLBACK for more.<BR>
</TD><TR VALIGN=top><TD><I>priority</I></TD>
<TD>Order in the priority chain.  Valid numbers are 0 to 1000, 0 being<BR>
highest priority (first), with 1000 being lowest priority (last).<BR>
Note that FSOUNDs soundeffects mixers and copy routines are considered<BR>
part of this DSP unit chain which you can play with.<BR>
</TD><TR VALIGN=top><TD><I>param</I></TD>
<TD>User defined parameter, this gets passed into the callback when it is<BR>
called.  It is safe to leave this value 0.<BR>
</TD></TABLE>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
On success, a pointer to a new valid DSP unit is returned.<BR>
On failure, NULL is returned.<BR>
<H3>Remarks</H3>
A dsp unit is NOT ACTIVE by default.  You have to activate it with FSOUND_DSP_SetActive<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Priorities and default system units.<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
A note on priorities.  FSOUND processes DSP units in order of priority.  A 0 priority<BR>
unit gets processed first, a 1 priority unit gets processed next, and so on.  <BR>
FSOUND actually uses these DSP units to mix its sound effects and music!  Yes, you have<BR>
access to them (be careful!).  It is possible to totally remove, replace or deactivate <BR>
all of FSOUND's system units so that it does nothing at all!<BR>
FSOUND has preinstalled default system units at the following priority locations:<BR>
FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_CLEARUNIT (priority 0) - Clear Unit.  This unit clears out <BR>
the mixbuffer for the next units to mix into.  You can disable this unit and replace<BR>
it with something other than a clearer, such as a scaler, which fades down the mix<BR>
buffer instead of clearing it, to produce a very rough echo effect.<BR>
FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_SFXUNIT (priority 100) - SFX Unit.  This unit mixes sound <BR>
effect channels into the mix buffer, which was previously cleared with the Clear <BR>
Unit.  <BR>
FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_MUSICUNIT (priority 200) - Music Unit.  This unit mixes all <BR>
music channels into the mix buffer, which was previously mixed into with the SFX <BR>
Unit.  <BR>
FSOUND_DSP_DEFAULTPRIORITY_CLIPANDCOPYUNIT (priority 1000) - Clip and Copy Unit.  This <BR>
unit takes the finally mixed buffer, and clips it to the output stream size (if it<BR>
needs to), and then sends it off to the sound device.  It is done last.  If this is<BR>
disabled you will hear no sound.<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Buffer Lengths.<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
The 'length' value of the DSP callback is roughly 20ms worth of data.<BR>
Use FSOUND_DSP_GetBufferLength to get the exact callback length.<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Buffer Widths<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Remember that FSOUND uses different buffer types depending on what type of mixer it is.<BR>
You will have to compensate for this by writing different routines depending on the <BR>
mixer type (ie mmx or non mmx), just like FSOUND does.  <BR>
Currently there are the 3 types of mixers and their buffer sizes.<BR>
You can get the type of mixer being used by calling the FSOUND_GetMixer function.<BR>
You may want to check on this inside your callback, or set up a function pointer system,<BR>
whatever you think is suitable (it costs nothing to do a FSOUND_GetMixer every time).<BR>
- FSOUND_MIXER_BLENDMODE : This buffer is a stereo, signed 32bit buffer (8 bytes per <BR>
sample).  The data is in integer format.<BR>
Data written to this buffer is not clipped and passed to the output stream until the <BR>
very end of the chain (the clip and copy unit).  For this type of mixer, you dont <BR>
have to worry about clipping becuase FSOUND does this for you.<BR>
- FSOUND_MIXER_QUALITY_FPU / FSOUND_MIXER_QUALITY_FPU_VOLUMERAMP: This buffer is also a <BR>
stereo, signed 32bit buffer (8 bytes per sample).  This data is in floating point <BR>
format.<BR>
The same clip and copy rules apply here as for the above mixer.<BR>
- Any MMX based mixer : This buffer is a stereo, signed 16bit buffer (4 bytes per sample).<BR>
When writing to this buffer, you must make sure the result does not overflow this <BR>
signed 16bit range.<BR>
If you add data into to this buffer, make sure it is clipped to a signed 16bit range<BR>
before writing it back.  FSOUND only copies this data to the output stream, it does<BR>
not clip it.<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
Speed<BR>
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
DSP Units are processed then and there, inside the mixing routine.  Remember to make<BR>
your process as FAST as possible, or the output device's play cursor will catch up to<BR>
FSOUND's write cursor while your routine takes its time to complete, and make it start <BR>
to break up.  <BR>
So basically, if it isnt fast, then FSOUND will not be able to send the data to the<BR>
output device in time for the next mixer update, and the result will be corrupted sound.<BR>
FSOUND_DSP_MixBuffers is available now, so if you need to mix some raw data into the output <BR>
buffer quickly, you can use FSOUND's own optimized mixer directly to do it!<BR>
Finally, you can see how your routine affects cpu usage, by using FSOUND_GetCPUUsage.<BR>
The cpu usage returned by this function includes any time spent in DSP units as well.<BR>
(this function times everything).  If you are really bored, you can see how much FSOUND's<BR>
system units take cpu-wise, by turning them on and off and seeing how they affect <BR>
performance.<BR>
